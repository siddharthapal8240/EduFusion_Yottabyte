## Problem ‚úí
Traditional education lacks interactive tools, resulting in disengagement and limited retention of knowledge. Static maps and textbooks fail to provide immersive learning experiences, hindering effective exploration of knowledge.

## Solution üèÜ
EduFusion addresses this problem by offering an interactive learning platform where users can physically interact with a map, explore countries, and engage in educational games. By integrating physical touch with digital technology, EduFusion provides a hands-on approach to learning geography, fostering deeper understanding and retention of geographical knowledge.
